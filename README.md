Navigating Virtual Worlds with RL Algorithms: A Brief Overview

This project explores the application of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in navigating custom complex gym environments and Atari image-based environments using the PyTorch library.

implemented a range of RL algorithms, including value-based algorithms like Q-learning, Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Double DQN, as well as policy-based algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). These algorithms were adapted to handle custom complex gym environments, which offer more intricate state and action spaces compared to simpler grid or cart pole environments.

To address the challenges of image-based environments, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were employed in conjunction with RL algorithms. The CNNs were used to process raw pixel inputs from the Atari environments, allowing the RL algorithms to learn directly from visual representations.

To enhance the performance of the RL algorithms, utilized techniques such as experience replay, reward shaping, and exploration strategies. Experience replay involved storing the agent's experiences in a replay buffer and randomly sampling batches of experiences for training, improving learning efficiency and stability. Reward shaping provided additional guidance to the agent during training, and exploration strategies helped balance exploration and exploitation to discover optimal policies.

By evaluating the performance of these RL algorithms in various custom complex gym and Atari environments, we were able to observe their effectiveness in navigating and optimizing performance. Through the analysis of rewards plots and results, we gained insights into the learning capabilities and adaptability of the RL agents in these complex virtual worlds.

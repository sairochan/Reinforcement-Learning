        "We will be working with an implementation of the Wumpus World environment. The environment comes from the book \"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach\" by Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig. \n",

        "### ENVIRONMENT DETAILS:\n",
        "\n",
        "The environment is a 6 x 6 grid world containing a total of 36 grid blocks. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### ENVIRONMENT OBJECTS:\n",
        "The environment consists of the following objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Agent** - The agent starts in the grid block at the bottom left corner whose co-ordinates are [0, 0]. The goal of our agent is to collect the Gold while avoiding the Wumpus and the pits. \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Wumpus** - The monster which would eat the agent if they are in the same grid block.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Pit** - The agent must avoid falling into the pits. \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Gold** - The agent must collect the Gold.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Breeze** - Breeze surrounds the Pits and warn the agent of a Pit in an adjacent grid block.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Stench** - Stench surrounds the Wumpus and warns the agent of the Wumpus in an adjacent grid block.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### ENVIRONMENT OBSERVATIONS:\n",
        "\n",
        "Our implementation of the environment provides you with four different types of observations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Integer** - Integer in the range [0 - 35]. This represents the grid block the agent is in. E.g., if the agent is in the bottom left grid block (starting position) the observation would be 0, if the agent is in the grid block containing the Gold the observation would be 34, if the agent is in the top right grid block the observation would be 35.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Vector** - \n",
        "\n",
        "    **2.1.** A vector of length 2 representing the agent co-ordinates. The first entry represents the x co-ordinate and the second entry represets the y co-ordinate. E.g., if the agent is in the bottom left grid block (starting position) the observation would be [0, 0], if the agent is in the grid block containing the Gold the observation would be [4, 5], if the agent is in the top right grid block the observation would be [5, 5].\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **2.2.** A vector of length 36 representing the one-hot encoding of the integer observation (refer type 1 above). E.g., if the agent is in the bottom left grid block (starting position) the observation would be [1, 0, ..., 0, 0], if the agent is in the grid block containing the Gold the observation would be [0, 0, ..., 1, 0], if the agent is in the top right grid block the observation would be [0, 0, ..., 0, 1].\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Image** - Image render of the environment returned as an NumPy array. The image size is 84 * 84 (same size used in the DQN paper). E.g., if the agent is in the bottom right grid block the observation is:\n",
